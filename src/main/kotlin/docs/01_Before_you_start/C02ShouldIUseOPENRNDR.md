# Should I use OPENRNDR ?

## Target audience

If you are new to both computer graphics and programming itself we suggest to first get your feet wet in the Processing language.Processing is specifically developed for the beginning programmer and offers a likely less steep learning curve. That said, we believe OPENRNDR is developed with an aim on simplicity and consistency and should not be super hard to learn.

## Supported platforms

OPENRNDR currently targets desktop platforms including MacOS, Windows and Linux. Support for Arduino and Android platforms is currently future sound.

OPENRNDR requires a graphics accelerator that supports at least OpenGL 3.3.This includes relatively old GPUs like nVidia 320M, Intel HD4000 but excludes Intel HD3000 for example.


## Supported programming languages

OPENRNDR is written in Kotlin and intended to run on the JVM . We believe Kotlin offers a well balanced programming language that is both expressive and easy to read.

The library can likely be used from Java 8 as that's one of the promises of Kotlin's Java interop.
Supported development environments

OPENRNDR is environment agnostic, however all our tutorial and reference material assumes Gradle and IntelliJ are used.
## Long-term support

We have not reached to the point at which we can make promises regarding API stability . We try not to break things, but at this point it is in cases better to break than to continue with inconsistencies or incompleteness.
